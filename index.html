                <p>
                    I am a PhD student researching at the intersection of artificial intelligence and systems engineering. 
                    My work focuses on developing practical solutions that bridge theoretical computer science with real-world applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My research interests include machine learning systems, distributed computing, and human-computer interaction. 
                    I am particularly interested in how we can design intelligent systems that are both powerful and accessible to 
                    end users across various domains.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am open to academic collaborations and industrial partnerships that can create meaningful impact through 
                    innovative technology solutions.
